This feature is responsible the authentication of the catalog.

## Canvas auth

When we navigate to the login page of a catalog instance we will be redirected to canvas login page.
After successfully login, the system will redirect us to catalog dashboard.

Different user role can login to the system.

User needs to be able to logs out from the system.

The user is logged out in the other browser tabs as well.
